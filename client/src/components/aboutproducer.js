                <p className="about-text">
                Dr. P. is The Producer and founder of FIA Corporation. 
                His talents within FIA Corporation includes music of all genres with gospel at its center. 
                While his artist and associate list is extensive, he is currently allowing his production focus 
                to chart its own course as he produces both instrumental and vocal original arrangements.
                Although his experience in live concerts is evident in his production style, he prefers the studio 
                and has more than 40 cd's produced under FIA Productions and Atlanta Sub Factor Productions. 
                He is a gifted talent and his tracks reflect multi-instrument jazz, film scoring tracks, and TV production 
                music support.
